This project contains the codes for the stocahstic simulations and determinstic dynamics for the Manuscript "Parasite-mediated predation determines the infection in a complex predator-prey-parasite system".

1. Stochastic_simulations.py : Stochastic simulations of our predator-prey-parasite system with a standard Gillespie Algorithm.
2. ParameterHeatMaps_Deterministic_CollectData.py: Numerical simulations of the deterministic equation for the main figures.
3. PopulationPlots_Supplementary_CoexistanceBehaviour.py : Numerical simulations of the deterministic equation for Supplementary figures.
